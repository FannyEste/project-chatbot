For the project week # we had to create a chatbot that can interact with users, ask questions, display messages, and respond with precision, using mostly JS.

 
## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

I was again stick to the steps that we go, and I readed carefully the predeterminated comments that were added to the file, and trying out what was already there helped me to understand a bit more each function. 

I had problems setting the time with setTimeout for the second message, and I still trying to understand what happened there, if I had more time I would fix it to make it work in a smoother way. 

This time I repeated a few times some of the videos in the weekly material for a deeper understanding, I tried to watch some youtube videos in my native language and english to have more clear the concepts, and as usual I got a some help from chatgpt and w3school and stack overflow.
